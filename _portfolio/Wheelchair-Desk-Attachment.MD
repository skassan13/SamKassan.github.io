# Features

*  **Removable Clamp Design:** Securely clamps onto the wheelchair armrest and can be attached or removed without tools, making setup quick and simple for both the user and caregivers.
* **Swing-Up Functionality:** Pivots upward to fold neatly over the armrest, creating a stable, flat surface for writing, drawing, or other creative activities. When not in use, the desk swings downward to stay out of the way, allowing the wheelchair to be used normally without obstruction.
* **Lightweight & Durable:** Made from CO₂ laser-cut MDF, ensuring the desk is lightweight for easy handling while maintaining structural strength and stability.
* **User-Centered Design:** Tailored specifically for a child with Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, prioritizing independence, accessibility, and comfort.

# Features

* **Precision Drive:** Powered by a stepper motor coupled to a lead screw, the pump delivers highly accurate and repeatable motion. Flow rate is fully programmable in the Arduino code with a single variable.
* **Syringe Flexibility:** Compatible with 10â€“20 mL syringes, which can be loaded and secured without tools. Both ends of the syringe are supported to eliminate sagging during operation, ensuring consistent flow.
* **Simple Controls:** Intuitive user interface with a latching start/pause button and a built-in limit switch to automatically stop when the syringe is empty.
* **LED Status Indicator:** Clear visual feedback provided by the LED light: ðŸŸ¢ green when running, ðŸŸ¡ yellow when paused, and ðŸ”´ red when the syringe is empty.
* **Clean & Compact Design:** Electronics are combined into a single protected enclosure that shields the power supply, Arduino, and breadboard from users and liquid exposure. Soldered and heat-shrinked connections keep wiring tidy and secure.
* **User-Friendly Extras:** Two momentary buttons allow manual forward/backward motor control for quick syringe setup, and a potentiometer enables real-time flow rate adjustments.
